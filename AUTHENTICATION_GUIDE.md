# Firebase Authentication Guide

## ✅ What's Been Created

### 1. **Authentication Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Manages global authentication state
- Provides login, signup, and logout functions
- Automatically tracks user authentication status

### 2. **Login Page** (`src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- Beautiful, modern login form
- Email/password authentication
- Toggle between Login and Sign Up modes
- Error handling and loading states
- Redirects to dashboard after successful login

### 3. **Dashboard Page** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Protected route (only accessible when logged in)
- Displays user email
- Logout functionality
- Ready for your custom features

### 4. **Private Route Component** (`src/components/PrivateRoute.tsx`)
- Protects routes from unauthorized access
- Automatically redirects to login if not authenticated

### 5. **Routing Setup** (`src/App.tsx`)
- Routes configured:
  - `/login` - Login page
  - `/dashboard` - Dashboard (protected)
  - `/` - Redirects to login

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test the Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**: 
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Click "Sign Up" 
   - Enter email and password (min 6 characters)
   - Click "Sign Up" button

2. **Login**:
   - Enter your email and password
   - Click "Login"

3. **Protected Routes**:

   - You'll be automatically redirected to login

4. **Logout**:
   - Click the "Logout" button in the dashboard
   - You'll be redirected to login page

## 🔒 Firebase Security

Your Firebase credentials are already configured in `src/services/firebase.ts`. Make sure to:
1. Set up authentication rules in Firebase Console
2. Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
3. Consider adding environment variables for production

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Add password reset functionality
2. Add email verification
3. Implement social authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)
4. Add user profile management
5. Build out your dashboard features
6. Add loading animations

Enjoy building your app! 🎉
