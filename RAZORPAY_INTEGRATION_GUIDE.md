# Razorpay Payment Integration Guide

## üéØ Overview

Your hospital management system now has a complete appointment booking and payment system using Razorpay. Here's how everything works:

## üîë Razorpay Test Credentials

```javascript
Key ID: rzp_test_XiEOZcAjQ3Gu0D
Key Secret: QQhXR0UOmNmZbQCDRX8zTMoa

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Database Structure

#### Firestore Collections:

**1. appointments/**
```javascript
{
  id: "APT1729445123456",
  patientId: "PAT...",
  patientName: "John Doe",
  patientEmail: "patient@example.com",
  doctorId: "DOC...",
  doctorName: "Dr. Smith",
  doctorEmail: "doctor@example.com",
  timeSlot: "09-10",
  appointmentDate: timestamp,
  status: "scheduled", // scheduled | completed | cancelled
  paymentStatus: "completed", // pending | completed | failed
  razorpayOrderId: "order_...",
  razorpayPaymentId: "pay_...",
  razorpaySignature: "signature...",
  amount: 500,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

**2. doctors/{userId}**
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  slots: {
    "09-10": false,  // false = available
    "10-11": true,   // true = booked
    "14-15": false
  }
}
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Development)
- ‚úÖ Client-side Razorpay integration
- ‚úÖ Test mode credentials
- ‚úÖ Protected routes
- ‚úÖ Firebase authentication

### For Production (Recommended)
1. **Move payment order creation to backend:**
   ```javascript
   // Backend API (Node.js example)
   app.post('/create-order', async (req, res) => {
     const order = await razorpay.orders.create({
       amount: 50000, // ‚Çπ500 in paise
       currency: 'INR',
       receipt: `receipt_${Date.now()}`
     });
     res.json(order);
   });
   ```

2. **Verify payment signature on backend:**
   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');
   
   app.post('/verify-payment', (req, res) => {
     const { orderId, paymentId, signature } = req.body;
     const generated_signature = crypto
       .createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_KEY_SECRET')
       .update(orderId + "|" + paymentId)
       .digest('hex');
     
     if (generated_signature === signature) {
       // Payment is valid
       res.json({ verified: true });
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Set up Firestore security rules:**
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null && 
           (resource.data.patientId == request.auth.uid ||
            resource.data.doctorId == request.auth.uid);
         allow create: if request.auth != null;
         allow update: if request.auth != null &&
           resource.data.patientId == request.auth.uid;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Use environment variables:**
   ```env
   VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_XiEOZcAjQ3Gu0D
   VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=QQhXR0UOmNmZbQCDRX8zTMoa
   ```
