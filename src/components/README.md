# Components

This folder contains reusable React components.

## Structure
- Each component should have its own folder if it has multiple files (styles, tests, etc.)
- Simple components can be single files

## Example
```
components/
  ├── Button/
  │   ├── Button.tsx
  │   ├── Button.css
  │   └── index.ts
  └── Card.tsx
```
